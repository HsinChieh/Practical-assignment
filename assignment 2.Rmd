### Dataset

#### This dataset is regarding a survey from 1,058 American respondents responses about what they eat on Thanksgiving in 2015. I have named this dataset to *thanksmeals*.

```{r}

thanksmeals <- read_csv("thanksgiving_meals.csv")

```

### Part 2: Data Wrangling and Visualization (60 Marks)

For all tables below, you need to use the RMarkdown functionality to present tables (`kable`). 

### 1. Display the first 10 rows of the dataset using RMarkdown

#### By using `head()`function can display 6 rows of the dataset automatically, I put 10 based on the requirements and used `kable()` to show the results in the table.

```{r}

head(thanksmeals, 10) %>% kable()

```
### 2. Use `fct_reorder` and `parse_number` functions to create a factor variable `family_income`

#### This question requires us to transform the categorical (character) variables 'family_income' into factor variable. By using `class()` to check character,the next step is to use `parse_number(var_name)`function, which can remove any non-numeric characters before or after the first number. The syntax is **data %>% mutate(var_name = fct_reorder(var_name, parse_number(var_name)))**. Finally, we can use `class()` again and it convert to factor; we can use `skim()`to ckeck as well.

```{r}

class(thanksmeals$family_income)

family_income <- thanksmeals %>% 
  mutate(family_income = fct_reorder(family_income, parse_number(family_income)))

class(family_income$family_income)

skim(family_income)

```

### 3. Generate the general statistics of the dataset using `summary()` and `skim()` function (2 mark).

#### Both `summary()` and `skim()` function can see the summary statistics of the dataset. The difference I noticed is that`summary()` shows class and mode for every variable separately, and `skim()` shows the missing value and compares each variable together.

```{r}

summary(thanksmeals)

skim(thanksmeals)

```
### 4. What is the number of people who celebrate?

#### By using `filter()`function, we can only filter the value we want. In the dataset, There are "Yes" and "No" in the variable of celebrate, so I put `filter(celebrate == "Yes")` and `count()` the number of celebrate.

```{r}

thanksmeals %>% 
  filter(celebrate == "Yes") %>% 
  count(celebrate) %>% 
  kable(caption = "Count")

```

### 5. What are categories and stats for each main dish served and the method it is prepared?

#### I used `count()` and `filter()` to get the results. Firstly, I count the total number for each main_dish and main_prep. Then, I use filter to deselect value which are "na", "Other (please specify)" because I think this kind of values cannot belong to any count. 

```{r}

thanksmeals %>% 
  count(main_dish, main_prep, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(main_dish),
         !is.na(main_prep),
         !main_dish %in% c("Other (please specify)", "I don't know"),
         !main_prep %in% c("Other (please specify)", "I don't know")) %>% 
  kable(caption = "Categories for Prepared Method")


```

### 6. Create a data viz showing this in the most evident way. Provide your own legend and use themes.

#### From the result of Q5, there are three variables (main_dish, main_prep, n). I create bar chart to show the count of prepared method for each main dish since main prep= discrete and count number= continuous. 


```{r}

thanksmeals %>% 
  filter(!is.na(main_prep),
         !is.na(main_dish),
         !main_dish %in% c("Other (please specify)", "I don't know"),
         !main_prep %in% c("Other (please specify)", "I don't know"))%>% 
  count(main_dish, main_prep) %>% 
  mutate(main_prep = fct_lump(main_prep, n=5),
         main_prep = fct_reorder(main_prep, n)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(main_prep, n, fill = main_dish)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x="Prepared Methods", y="Count", title="Main Dish Prepared Methods Distribution", fill= "Main Dish", caption = "Image 1:Bar Graph")

```

### 7. How many use cranberry sauce? How many use gravy?

#### For gravy sauce, there are two types of values, so it is easy to use `filter()` and then count the number. For cranberry sauce, there are many types of values, such as other (please specify), homemade, canned and na; therefore, I used filter to deselect na values, but I keep other (please specify) because respondents put the answer in cranberry_other, which belong to the use of cranberry sauce. Then, I count the number and add all count.

```{r}

#There are 828 people used cranberry sauce.

thanksmeals %>% 
  filter(!is.na(cranberry),
         !cranberry=="None") %>% 
  count(cranberry) %>% 
  select(n) %>% 
  summarise(cranberry_sauce = sum(n)) %>% 
  kable(caption = "The number of using cranberry sauce")

#There are 892 people used gravy sauce.

thanksmeals %>% 
  filter(gravy=="Yes") %>% 
  count(gravy) %>% 
  kable(caption = "The number of using gravy sauce")

```

### 8. What is the distribution of those who celebrate across income ranges

#### In this question, I need to count the variables of family_income with people celebrate. To get the results, I used `group_by()` to group celebrate first, used `filter()` to filter the variables I want, count the family_income and make them in order, and finally used`ungroup()` to avoid messing the dataset.

```{r}

thanksmeals %>% 
  group_by(celebrate)%>% 
  filter(celebrate=="Yes",
         !is.na(family_income),
         !family_income %in% c("Prefer not to answer")) %>% 
  count(family_income, sort = TRUE) %>%
  ungroup() %>% 
  kable(caption = "Family Income Distribution")

```

### 9. Present this information in the most evident way on the data viz.

#### I want to create bar chart to show the count for different family income. Most steps at first are the same with Q8. Then, I use `fct_reorder() `to reorder the factor(family_income) level, and I also put `coord_flip()`to avoid the messy of x names. 

```{r}

thanksmeals %>% 
  filter(celebrate=="Yes",
         !is.na(family_income),
         !family_income %in% c("Prefer not to answer")) %>% 
  count(family_income) %>% 
  mutate(family_income = fct_reorder(family_income,n)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(family_income,n)) +
  geom_col(fill="#FF3399") +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(x="Family Income", y="Number", title="The Distribution of Income by People who Celebrate Thanksgiving", caption = "Image 2:Bar Graph")

```

### 10. What are the most common pies, sides, and desserts?

#### To count the most repeated values in many columns, we need to use `start_with()` & `gather()`. The former is to select the same few words in different columns, while the latter is to gather a set of column name in a type column and their values in another column. Besides,`str_remove()` function used to delete some characters in a string since I want to make them same type. (\d: numeric 0-9; \d+: more than one numeric, such as 11,12...)

```{r}

#the most common pie is pumpkin pie

common_pie <- thanksmeals %>% 
  select(starts_with("pie")) %>% 
  gather(type,value) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(value),
         !value %in% c("None", "Other (please specify)","I don't know")) %>% 
  group_by(type) %>% 
  count(value, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(type = str_remove(type, "\\d+"))

head(common_pie,10) %>% 
  kable(caption = "Common Pie")
  
#the most common side is mashed potatoes

common_side <- thanksmeals %>% 
  select(starts_with("side")) %>% 
  gather(type,value) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(value),
         !value %in% c("None", "Other (please specify)","I don't know")) %>% 
  group_by(type) %>% 
  count(value, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(type = str_remove(type, "\\d+"))


head(common_side,10) %>% 
  kable(caption = "Common Side")

#the most common dessert is ice cream

common_dessert <- thanksmeals %>% 
  select(starts_with("dessert")) %>% 
  gather(type,value) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(value),
         !value %in% c("None", "Other (please specify)","I don't know")) %>% 
  group_by(type) %>% 
  count(value, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(type = str_remove(type, "\\d+"))

head(common_dessert,10) %>% 
  kable(caption = "Common Dessert")

```

### 11. Present this information on a data viz

#### With `fct_lump()` function, we can limit how many categories we want to show by making other low values into a level called "other". I believe that bar chart can present well since there are one discrete variable and one continuous variable. 

```{r}

thanksmeals %>% 
  select(starts_with("pie")) %>% 
  gather(type,value) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(value),
         !value %in% c("None", "Other (please specify)","I don't know")) %>% 
  group_by(type) %>%
  mutate(value = fct_lump(value, 5)) %>% 
  count(value, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(type = str_remove(type, "\\d+")) %>%
  mutate(value = fct_reorder(value, n)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(value, n, fill=value))+
  geom_col()+
  coord_flip()+
  theme_gray()+
  labs(x="Type of Pie", y="Number", title="The Most Common Pie in Thanksgiving", fill ="Types",caption = "Image 3:Bar Graph")


thanksmeals %>% 
  select(starts_with("side")) %>% 
  gather(type,value) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(value),
         !value %in% c("None", "Other (please specify)","I don't know")) %>% 
  group_by(type) %>%
  mutate(value = fct_lump(value, 5)) %>% 
  count(value, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(type = str_remove(type, "\\d+")) %>%
  mutate(value = fct_reorder(value, n)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(value, n, fill=value))+
  geom_col()+
  coord_flip()+
  theme_gray()+
  labs(x="Type of Side", y="Number", title="The Most Common Side in Thanksgiving", fill ="Types",caption = "Image 4:Bar Graph")

thanksmeals %>% 
  select(starts_with("dessert")) %>% 
  gather(type,value) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(value),
         !value %in% c("None", "Other (please specify)","I don't know")) %>% 
  group_by(type) %>%
  mutate(value = fct_lump(value, 5)) %>% 
  count(value, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(type = str_remove(type, "\\d+")) %>%
  mutate(value = fct_reorder(value, n)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(value, n, fill=value))+
  geom_col()+
  coord_flip()+
  theme_gray()+
  labs(x="Type of Dessert", y="Number", title="The Most Common Dessert in Thanksgiving", fill ="Types",caption = "Image 5:Bar Graph")
```

### 12. How do the servings differ by income?

#### In order to compare between family_income and main_dish, I count the family income for each main dish by using `count()` as well as similar functions such as filter and group by, trying to deselect missing values.

```{r}

servings_income <- thanksmeals %>%
  select(main_dish,family_income) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(main_dish),
         !is.na(family_income),
         !main_dish %in% c("Other (please specify)", "I don't know"),
         !family_income %in% c("None", "Prefer not to answer")) %>%
  group_by(main_dish) %>% 
  count(main_dish, family_income, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  ungroup()

head(servings_income,10) %>% 
  kable(caption = "Comparison between family_income and main_dish")

```

### 13. Present this information on a data viz

#### To show the distribution for each main dish and family income, I use bar chart to present. Firstly, I have the new dataset named 'servings_income' created in Q12. Then, I use fuctions to limit categories and reorder factor level. After that, flip the x and y position after ggplot the data in order to make the name of x variables clear.

```{r}

servings_income %>% 
  group_by(main_dish) %>% 
  mutate(family_income = fct_reorder(family_income, n)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(family_income,n, fill=main_dish))+
  geom_col()+
  coord_flip()+
  facet_wrap(~main_dish)+
  labs(x="Family Income", y="Count", title="The Comparison between Family Income and Main Dish", fill="Main Dish", caption = "Image 6:Bar Graph")

servings_income %>% 
  mutate(main_dish = fct_lump( main_dish, n=5)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(family_income, n, fill = main_dish))+
  geom_col()+
  coord_flip()+
  labs(x="Family Income", y="Count", title="The Comparison between Family Income and Main Dish", fill="Main Dish", caption = "Image 7:Bar Graph")
